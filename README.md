## 🌊 HydroPulse

“Every Drop Counts, Every Habit Changes.”


## ✨ Overview

💧 HydroPulse is a smart water-saving solution designed to tackle unconscious water wastage.
Through psychological nudges, real-time simulations, and intuitive green-themed UI, HydroPulse transforms ordinary taps into awareness-driven experiences.

Instead of just limiting water, HydroPulse influences behavior — making people more mindful of their daily usage in public spaces and beyond.

## 🧪 Hypothesis

People waste water because they don’t see the impact in real-time.
If taps display wasted water, people will immediately change their behavior.

## 🔬 Test Method

- 🛠️ Instead of building hardware, we simulated it with a concept video prototype showing the tap + counter idea.

- 🎯 The goal is to use human behavior rather than brute-forcing rules.

- 🔢 The counter displays the amount of water wasted in real time.

- 💡 Users start thinking: “Oh! I’m wasting a lot of water for just a simple hand wash… I need to do better next time.”

- 🌍 The main target is public spaces where people waste unconsciously. Let’s introduce consciousness.

- 👥 When we asked our classmates if they’d reduce waste after seeing their wasted count, most said:
“If I’m seeing a number, of course I’m gonna think about it.”

## ✅ What Worked

✔️ The counter clearly shows waste
✔️ Users react quickly when presented with visible numbers

## ⚠️ What Didn’t

❌ Currently only a simulation
❌ Needs real IoT/hardware integration to fully validate

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Live Simulation – Interactive visual flow showing water usage in real time
✔️ Behavioral Nudges – Subtle, psychology-driven feedback that encourages conservation
✔️ Gamified Counters – Tracks drops saved without overwhelming the user
✔️ Outcome Dashboard – Displays how small changes scale to big environmental impacts
✔️ Serverless Backend – Smooth, lightweight, and scalable without deployment hassles
✔️ Stunning UI/UX – 🌿 Green-themed, animated, and modern design for maximum engagement

## 🧠 Why It Matters

- 🌍 Every drop wasted is a resource lost. HydroPulse doesn’t just measure usage —
it changes habits by:

- Nudging public space users (schools, offices, cafes, etc.)

- Scaling to households and industries

- Showing the psychological ripple effect of conservation

⚡ Small behavior shifts → Massive environmental change.
